                Smoke alarms could be the difference between life and death and
                majority of fire related fatalities are in premises without a
                working smoke alarm. It amazes me that most residential homes
                are not equipped with them when the safety of people's families
                are almost always the number one priority.
              </p>

              <p class="paragraph paragraph--dark-gray paragraph--semi">
                Through consumer feedback we realised there is a misconception
                that smoke alarms are complicated to install and expensive, this
                couldn’t be further from the truth. We have created a range of
                quality products that meet European safety standards, battery
                operated, self install and affordable with prices starting at a
                cost as little as what a person would spend on a takeaway. Here
                at Fire Alert  we are passionate about educating and providing
                affordable lifesaving solutions for the benefit of all,
                abusiness with a purpose.

              While on vacation in South Africa he noticed that most residential
              properties were not equipped with smoke alarms. Coming from a
              country with so much awareness on the risks that come with fires
              and the importance of smoke alarms he started researching the
              South African market.

                To understand why this was the case consumer research was
                conducted and the results showed most South Africans were
                conscious of fire safety however believed smoke alarms were
                complicated to install and expensive. Taking these two concerns
                into consideration Yusuf sourced and created a range of products
                which were easy self-install and affordable to meet different
                budgets. All products were designed to ensure they met European
                certification standards, as much as creating a successful
                business was important it was more important to be providing
                quality products with safety features to ensure the safety of
                our clients in case of an emergency.
